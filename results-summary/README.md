# Results summary - Frontend Mentor Project

A React component to get familiar with the React framework and the functions components. I'll also use a library named styled-components to ease my touch with the style of the app.

This component shows some results based on data given in the data.json of the project (allowing us to also work with some JS programmation).

## Realisation details

It has been strangely almost hard to do! But that's understandable by the facts the I 
* didn't had my hands on functional React components
* added styled-components to my stack and had a hard time figuring out how to do the linear-gradients
based on the theme 
* changed editor for trying (passed from Vim to VSCode)
* tried to apply the mobile-first development way.

Once these practical (and psychological) barriers passed, the thing just rolled on quite quickly.  
I used styled-components with parcimony as I was not really much familiar with it, only for "decomposing"
my style into General / Score Component / Summary Component section, which have been really helpful.

## Built with

* React
* HTML/CSS/JS
* styled-components
