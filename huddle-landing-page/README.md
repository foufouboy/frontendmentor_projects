# Huddle Community landing page - Frontend Mentor Project

A React web app of a community landing page 
that is intended to help me familiarize myself with styled-components.

[Live Demo ðŸ‘ˆ](https://foufouboy.github.io/frontendmentor_projects/huddle-landing-page/build/)

## Realisation details

Built with the styled-component crash course video of Traversy Media, at first.
Then i wanted to publish it to Frontend Mentor but it was way too off the original design.
So i spend a LOT of time refactorizing it, and i'm not proud at all at what i finally achieved. The style code is a hot load of garbage and i've had that impression of having to redo the whole project.  

I don't think it was a miscomprehention of styled-components way-of-doing, more that the way Traversy Media coded it was too far from my standards, which made it for me completely non-evolutive.

I don't think i'll ever come back at that project, and it is obviously one of my worst, but i'd to know that, more or less, i'd come to the end of it.

## Built with
